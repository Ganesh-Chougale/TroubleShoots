**Overtype Mode (Insert Mode)** is enabled in VS Code. In this mode, when you type, it **replaces** characters instead of inserting them.  

### üîß **Fix:** Disable Overtype Mode  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Press `Insert` Key** (on your keyboard) ‚Äì This toggles between **Insert Mode & Overtype Mode**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ If `Insert` key doesn‚Äôt work, restart VS Code.  

### **Check if Overtype Mode is Active**  
- Look at the **bottom right corner** of VS Code.  
- If you see `OVR`, it means Overtype Mode is **ON**.  
- Press `Insert` to turn it off, and it should change to `INS` (Insert Mode).
